****Fitness assays (p. 97 B. Woods)
for the assays, do red of left versus white of right, as well as
white of left versus red of right.

For each assay, two clones are inoculated separately into flasks containing LB
liquid medium from the freezer stocks and allowed to grow for 24 hours at 37C.
These cultures were then diluted 100 fold, and 0.1ml is transferred to 9.9ml
DM25, where the cultures were again allowed to grow separately for 24 hours at
37C. This step allows for physiological acclimation to the competition
conditions. 

The two clones were then mixed at 6 initial volumetric ratios,
 and a combined 0.1ml was added to 9.9ml fresh DM25. A sample was taken
from this mixture, and plated onto TA agar to estimate the initial pop. density
of each type (Ni). The mixture was propagated for one or more days with daily
1:100 dilutions into fresh DM25 medium. At the end of the experiment, a second
sample of the mixture was plated onto TA agar to estimate the final density of
each type (Nf). The Malthusian parameter (m) is the realized growth rate of a
clone over the test period. It is calculated as m = ln(100^t * Nf/Ni)/(t), 
where t is the number of days, and where both counts reflect changes in overall
density based on the dilutions used for plating. The relative fitness of one
clone to another is the ratio of their Malthusian parameters.

Single clones are isolated from each clade, and Ara revertants are made from each.
Also do reverse competitions, where the
only difference is the polarity of the ara mutation.

6 replicate of each ratio, *2 for the two types * 3 for ratios = 36 total competitions.
do all the 10Ks on the same day, and do the 7.5Ks on the same day.

For frequency dependence, do intial volumetric ratios of 
(1:10, 1:1, 10:1), and do fitness assays that last 1 day.


plate 100ul on each plate, and plate 3 plates from each dilution tube.

***** Design for 10K FD experiment
do 10:1, 1:1, 1:10 ratios of the two competitors--don't need to worry about polarity of the mutation.
do 12 replicates of each ratio.
because the number of colonies for the rare competitor is low on the plate,
plate 3x for each dilution.
I will need 36*3 + 1 TA plates for day 0 and day 6: 110 plates for the experiment.
